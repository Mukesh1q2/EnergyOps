Quick additions & gaps to close (high priority)

Schema registry & CDC

Add Avro/Protobuf schema registry (Confluent/Apicurio) + Debezium for Change Data Capture to keep data contracts stable and enable safe schema evolution.

Data catalog & lineage

Central data catalog (DataHub/Amundsen) with lineage tracking, column-level metadata, PII tags, owners, and data quality scores.

Feature store & model explainability

Feature store (Feast) for consistent feature computation across training/serving.

Model explainability (SHAP/Integrated Gradients) and an “explain” endpoint for all ML predictions.

Model governance & CI for ML

Model registry (MLflow), automated retrain pipelines, model approval workflows, drift detection, and automated rollbacks.

Operational runbooks & playbooks

Incident runbooks (on-call steps, escalation, rollback, communication), runbook tests, and a runbook library per critical service.

SLOs, alerts & budgeted error-handling

Concrete SLOs with error budget and automated alerting thresholds (see sample SLOs below).

Backup, retention & recovery SLAs

Retention policy per data class, automated encrypted backups, quarterly restore drills, defined RTO/RPO per tier.

End-to-end testing & chaos

E2E tests (Playwright), contract tests for APIs, load tests (k6), and periodic chaos engineering (chaos monkey) for resilience validation.

Privacy & legal

DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment), consent management, cookie policy controls, export & delete data flows (data subject requests), India data-residency enforcement.

Vendor / Market-feed integrations

Standard connectors for market feeds (PX/day-ahead, frequency/SCADA, weather, ISO APIs). Include contract/legal SLA review for each feed.

Cost visibility & billing telemetry

Per-org cost meters (compute, storage, model tokens) surfaced in billing to prevent runaway charges.

Governance for LLM & automation

Guardrails & human-in-the-loop for auto-bids; LLM provenance + RAG citations + audit trail for suggestions.

Concrete SLO / SLA suggestions (examples you can adopt)

Availability: 99.9% for core API and dashboard (enterprise) — measured monthly.

Latency:

Dashboard initial render (avg): < 2s

Time-series query (1h window): p95 < 300ms

Forecast API: p95 < 2s for small payload; < 10s for large jobs (async recommended)

Data ingestion: 99% of events accepted and available in timeseries DB within 30s.

Model freshness: retrain triggers when drift > threshold or every X days (configurable).

RTO / RPO:

Critical systems: RTO ≤ 1 hour, RPO ≤ 15 minutes

Non-critical: RTO ≤ 24 hours, RPO ≤ 6 hours

Add SLAs to pricing tiers and reflect financial credits/triggers in legal docs.

Data & security policies (practical defaults)

Retention: Raw events 90 days; aggregates 3 years; audit logs 7 years (configurable).

Encryption: TLS 1.2+, AES-256 at rest, KMS-managed keys rotated every 90 days.

Secrets: Rotate service credentials quarterly; no long-lived tokens in repos.

DLP: block exports of PII unless allowed by role + approval flow.

Pen test cadence: quarterly automated + annual manual pentest.

ML / LLM governance and safety

Experimentation: feature-branch model registry + canary inference traffic split (1-5%) before full roll-out.

Explainability: require SHAP or SHAP-like explanation for every production prediction; attach to LLM suggestions a confidence band and citation (RAG).

Human-in-loop: auto-bids require human approval above configurable thresholds (e.g., > $X or > Y MW).

LLM Safety: filter prompts for sensitive operations; sign every recommendation with source docs & last-updated timestamp.

Observability & monitoring (concrete alerts)

APM: track p99 latency, error rate > 1% triggers alert.

Ingestion: if Kafka consumer lag > X partitions for > 2 minutes → page on-call.

Storage: TimescaleDB disk > 80% → alert.

Model drift: data/label distribution shift > threshold → auto-create ticket + alert.

Audit integrity: if audit log append fails → immediate critical alert.

Testing matrix (must have)

Unit tests, integration tests, contract tests (schema evolution), E2E, accessibility (axe), performance/load tests, security scans (SAST/DAST), chaos runs, backup restore tests.

Pricing & metering operational details

Meter compute for model inferencing and streaming separately; expose usage dashboard.

Implement soft and hard quotas per org to avoid runaway cost.

Provide an “enterprise connector” SKU for on-prem LLM and private data residency.

Legal & compliance checklist

DPA, ToS, privacy policy with clear data flows.

SOC2 roadmap (controls map), ISO 27001 evidence pack.

Local compliance (India): data residency options & legal counsel review for market data reseller agreements.

Team & role recommendations (additions)

Add Data Governance Lead (owner of catalog, lineage, PII, retention).

Add SRE / On-call rotation with runbook ownership.

Add ML Ops Engineer managing model registry, drift, and feature store.

Add Compliance / Security Engineer for audits, pentests, vendor due diligence.
